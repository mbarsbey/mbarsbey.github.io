## Who am I?

I am a computer engineering PhD student with a focus on probabilistic machine learning. My research areas comprise of **causal inference, model selection, and latent variable modeling**. My advisor is Prof. A. Taylan Cemgil of Bogazici University, Istanbul. I have industry experience as a data scientist in time series analysis and high dimensional financial data. I also have a background e

## Causal discovery using Bayesian model selection

Our latest research involves the **use of Bayesian model selection to conduct causal structure learning** in the presence of latent confounders, including the notorious case of bivariate data. For example, distinguishing between the three graphical models depicted below is a challanging task, given that the last two are Markov equivalent.

We also use Bayesian inference to obtain confounder representations (e.g. by sampling from the posterior distribution of the latent confounder) and to produce counterfactual predictions.
