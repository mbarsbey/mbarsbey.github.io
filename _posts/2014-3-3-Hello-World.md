I am a computer engineering PhD student with a focus on probabilistic machine learning . My research areas comprise of causal inference, model selection, and latent variable modeling. My advisor is Prof. A. Taylan Cemgil of Bogazici University, Istanbul.

Our latest research involves the use of Bayesian model selection to conduct causal structure learning, in the presence of latent confounders, including the notorious case of bivariate data. For example, distinguishing between the three graphical models below is a challanging task, given that the last two are Markov equivalent.
